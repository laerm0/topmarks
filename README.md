Topmarks is a typeface family being developed in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of fonts suitable for everyday use in infant learning. The aim of developing Topmarks is to widen the choice of fonts available to use in creating teaching and educational resources for young children. 

The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License, so the fonts can be used freely in all kinds of ways, including; printing, as webfonts, and, embedding in digital documents and applications. Being Free Software, the Topmarks fonts can be used in commercial or non-commercial works, shared, given away, or even altered.

'Topmarks' is based on the Free Software font 'Muli'. Muli has already proved a useful font in classrooms, because of it's straightforward and legible design.

Topmarks is being developed in various weights and versions to suit various needs found in children's learning
