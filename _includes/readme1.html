<h4>Topmarks</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are being created in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of Free Software typefaces suitable for use in infant learning.</p>
<p>The aim of developing the fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and easily in everyday teaching.</p>
<h4>Free and open</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License, allowing the fonts to be used freely, by unlimited numbers of users.</p>
<p>The fonts can be used for printing, as webfonts, for setting
digital documents, embedding in other software, used in commercial or non-commercial work, and being Free Software, the Topmarks fonts can be shared, given away, or even altered.</p>
