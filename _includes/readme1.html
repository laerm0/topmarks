      <p>The Topmarks fonts are a free, open and easy to use family of fonts to be used in children's learning.</p>
<p>The fonts are being developed in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of <i>free</i> and <i>open source</i> typefaces suitable for use in infant learning. The project aims to  widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and easily in everyday teaching.</p>
