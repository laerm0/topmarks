<h4>Topmarks</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are being created in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of Free Software typefaces suitable for use in infant learning.</p>
<p>The aim of developing the fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and easily in everyday teaching.</p>
<h4>Free and open</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License, allowing the fonts to be used freely, by unlimited numbers of users.</p>
