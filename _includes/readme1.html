<h4>Topmarks</h4>
<p>The aim of developing these fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and easily in everyday teaching.

<h4>Free and open</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License. This license allows the fonts to be used freely, by unlimited numbers of users.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts can be used for printing, as webfonts, for setting
digital documents, and embedding in other software, used in commercial or non-commercial work, pretty much anything. Also, being Free Software, the Topmarks fonts can be shared, given away, or even altered.</p>
