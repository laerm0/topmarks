The Topmarks fonts are being created in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of Free Software typefaces suitable for use in infant learning. The aim of developing the fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces available to educationalists for use in their own applications to produce teaching resources such as worksheets and interactive whiteboard resources.</div>
