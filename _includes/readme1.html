<p>The Topmarks fonts are a free, open, and easy to use family of fonts to be used in children's learning. The project aims to widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and easily in everyday teaching.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are Free Software, released under the Open Font License. This means you are free to download and use the fonts yourself and give them away to share the fonts with others.</p>
<h4>Free and open</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are being created in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of Free Software typefaces suitable for use in infant learning.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License. This license allows the fonts to be used freely, by unlimited numbers of users.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts can be used for printing, as webfonts, for setting
digital documents, and embedding in other software, used in commercial or non-commercial work, pretty much anything. Also, being Free Software, the Topmarks fonts can be shared, given away, or even altered.</p>
