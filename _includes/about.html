            <p>Topmarks is a Free Software typeface family being developed for everyday use in infant learning.</p>
                <p>When young children are learning to read and write it makes sense that the letterforms they use make character recognition easier when reading, and also directs them to making correct marks, as handwriting. Traditionally, typefaces for reading are separate from handwriting, as they have different roots. Topmarks uses a type model that has it's roots in both hand written letterforms and book type.</p>
