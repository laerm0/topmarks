            <div class="jumbotron">

                <p>Topmarks fonts are designed to complement the way letter and number formation is taught in early years classrooms.</p>
 </div>
                
                <p>The Topmarks fonts have been developed out of the frustration of teachers, not finding fonts that completely match the letter and number styles that they teach.</p>
                
<p>When young children are learning to read and write it makes sense that the letterforms they use make character recognition easier when reading, and also directs them to making correct marks, as handwriting.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, typefaces for reading are separate from handwriting, as they have different roots. Topmarks uses a type model that has it's roots in both hand written letterforms and book type.</p>
                <p>The fonts are ideal for teaching and have many uses, from printables, such as worksheets, posters and class display materials, through to digital technologies such as word processing, interactive whiteboard resources and on web sites. The fact that Topmarks Fonts are Free Software means that all these uses can be covered freely and easilly, without the extra costs and complications that restrictive licensing can bring into the classroom.</p>
                
                
                <p>To accommodate the variations in the way that letters and numbers are formed, we are planning to provide alternative versions of characters, so you can make the font to appear just the way youâ€™d like.</p>

                    <p>The letterforms of Topmarks have been shaped to enable easy character recognition.</p>
                    <p>The forms have been kept simple and straightforward. Uniformity and repetition of form is used to amplify the similarity of some forms whilst amplifying the difference of others.</p>

            <p>The letterforms of Topmarks have been designed to direct children to the best ways to appraoch and write letterforms when they are learning to write by hand. The form of each letter makes writing more straightforward and helps the writing of each character flow into the formation of the next character.</p>
