<img src="assets/images/bbb.png" style="height:130px"/>
<img src="assets/images/eee.png" style="height:90px"/>
<p>The design of Topmarks fonts is based on the Free Software font 'Muli'. The underlying structure of Topmarks and Muli are the same, so they make good companions when used together.</p>
<p>Muli has already proved a useful font in classrooms, so it was a good starting point for Topmarks.</p>
<p>Topmarks is being developed in various weights and versions to suit the different needs found in children's learning.</p>
