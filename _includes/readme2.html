<img src="assets/images/topmarks-muli.png" style="padding: 13px 0 21px 0"/>

<p>The design of Topmarks fonts is based on the Free Software font 'Muli'.</p>
<p>Muli has already proved a useful font in classrooms, as it is a simple and very legible design, so it was a good starting point for Topmarks. The underlying basic structure of Topmarks and Muli are the same, so they also make good companions when used together.</p>

<p>Topmarks is being developed in various weights and versions to suit the different needs found in children's learning.</p>
<p>If you have some specific ideas for the development of Topmarks Fonts, or would like to report bugs or problems with the fonts, please send an email.</p>
