            <h3>Why Topmarks fonts?</h3>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are being developed in response to teachers
              and educators who find a lack of <i>free</i> and <i>open source</i>
              typefaces suitable for use in infant learning. The project aims to
              widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and
              easily in everyday teaching.</p>

            <h3>About the design</h3>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family
              'Muli', a sans-serif typeface that has proven popular with
              children and teachers.</p>
<p>The Muli font family is useful for teachers because the forms are straightforward and easy to read, but the forms of Muli are not quite right for infants learning to write. For this reason a version of Muli is being developed that can also be used to help young children form letter shapes as they are starting to write.</p>
