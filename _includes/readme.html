<p>The Topmarks fonts are a Free Software typeface family being developed in response to teachers and educators who have found a lack of fonts suitable and easilly available for everyday use in infant learning. The aim of developing the Topmarks fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces available for use in creating teaching and educational resources for young children.</p>

             <p>The design of Topmarks fonts is based on the Free Software font 'Muli'.</p>
             <p>Muli has already proved a useful font in classrooms, as a simple and legible design. The underlying basic structure of Topmarks and Muli are the same, so they also make good companions when used together.</p>
             <p>Topmarks is being developed in various weights and versions to suit the different needs found in children's learning.</p>
