        <h4>Free and open</h4>
            <p>The fonts are being developed in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of free and open source typefaces suitable for use in infant learning. The project aims to widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and easily in everyday teaching. The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, but lack other type features that can help young children starting to form their own handwriting. The Topmarks design takes the basic Muli letterforms but also incorporates forms and functions that are helpfull to young.</p></div>

        <h4>About the design</h4>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family
              'Muli', a sans-serif typeface that has already proven popular with
              children and teachers. The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, but lack other type features that can help young children starting to form their own handwriting. The Topmarks design takes the basic Muli letterforms but also incorporates forms and functions that are helpfull to young.</p></div>
