<p class="lead">About Topmarks Fonts</p>
<p style="font-family:'Roboto'">The Topmarks fonts are a Free Software typeface family being developed in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of typefaces suitable for use in infant learning. The aim of developing the fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces available to educationalists for use in their own applications to produce teaching resources such as worksheets and interactive whiteboard resources.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Roboto'"> The Topmarks fonts are being developed in various weights and includes the development of 'Topmarks Mono', a monospaced font for use in terminals and for coding.</p>
<p class="lead">Legibility and Function</p>
<p style="font-family:'Roboto'">The Topmarks fonts are designed primarily for optimised functionality on various types and sizes of screens. The fonts are designed to be functional; spartan and uncluttered, but with enough stylistic detailing to add distinction at larger sizes. Part of the brief in designing the Topmarks Fonts is that they could also be used for print and web 'branding' of free desktops.</p>
<p style="font-family:'Roboto'">The large x-height (above) ensures that text is clearly readable at standard desktop UI text sizes, even under lesser display options, or when viewed on small handheld devices.
</p>
<p class="lead">Free Software</p>
<p style="font-family:'Roboto'">The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License. This license allows the fonts to be used freely, by an unlimited numbers of users. The Topmarks fonts can be used for printing, as webfonts, for setting digital documents, embedding in other software, used in commercial or non-commercial work, pretty much anything. Also, being Free Software, the Topmarks fonts can be shared, given away, or even altered. </p>
