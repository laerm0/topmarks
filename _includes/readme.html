        <h4>Free and open</h4>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are being created in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of Free Software typefaces suitable for use in infant learning.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License. This license allows the fonts to be used freely, by unlimited numbers of users.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts can be used for printing, as webfonts, for setting
digital documents, and embedding in other software, commercial or non-commercial work, pretty much anything in fact. Also, being Free Software, the Topmarks fonts can be shared, given away, or even altered.</p>

        <h4>About the design</h4>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family
              'Muli', a typeface that has already proven popular with
              children and teachers.</p>
              <p>The design of Topmarks uses the basic Muli letterforms but also incorporates aspects that are helpfull to young learners.</p>
              <p>The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, plus extra features have been introduced, for example the extension of the ends of strokes that encourage a connection between the printed word and handwriting to help children form their own handwriting.</p></div>
