        <h4>Free and open</h4>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are being created in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of Free Software typefaces suitable for use in infant learning.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are released under the Open Font License. This license allows the fonts to be used freely, by unlimited numbers of users.</p>
<p>The Topmarks fonts can be used for printing, as webfonts, for setting
digital documents, and embedding in other software, used in commercial or non-commercial work, pretty much anything. Also, being Free Software, the Topmarks fonts can be shared, given away, or even altered.</p>

        <h4>About the design</h4>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family
              'Muli', a typeface that has already proven popular with
              children and teachers.</p>
              <p>The design of the Topmarks fonts is based solidly on Muli's letterforms but also incorporates aspects that are helpfull to young learners.</p>
              <p>The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, and extra features have been introduced with Topmarks to help children forming their own handwriting, for example, the extension of the ends of strokes that encourage a connection between the printed word and handwriting.</p></div>
