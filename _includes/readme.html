            <h4>Why Topmarks fonts?</h4>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are being developed in response to teachers
              and educators who find a lack of <i>free</i> and <i>open source</i>
              typefaces suitable for use in infant learning. The project aims to
              widen the choice of suitable typefaces that can be used freely and
              easily in everyday teaching.</p>

            <h4>About the design</h4>
            <p>The Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family
              'Muli', a sans-serif typeface that has alreday proven popular with
              children and teachers. The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, but are not quite right for infants also learning to write. The Topmarks design takes the basic Muli letterforms but also incorporates other forms that are helpfull when young children are learning to form letter shapes in their own hand writing.</p>
