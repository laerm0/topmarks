<p>The Topmarks fonts are a Free Software typeface family being developed in response to teachers and educators who find a lack of fonts suitable for use in infant learning. The aim of developing the Topmarks fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces available for use in teaching resources such as worksheets and interactive whiteboard resources.</p>
<p> The Topmarks fonts are being developed in various weights and versions to suit the different needs found in children's learning.</p>
