<p>The Topmarks fonts are a Free Software typeface family being developed in response to teachers and educators who have found a lack of fonts suitable and easilly available for everyday use in infant learning. The aim of developing the Topmarks fonts is to widen the choice of suitable typefaces available for use in creating teaching and educational resources for young children.</p>
