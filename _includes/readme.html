<h4>About the design</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family 'Muli', a typeface that has already proven popular with children and teachers.</p>
<p>The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, with the Topmarks design introducing features that help children start to form their own handwriting.</p>
<p>Topmarks provides clear and easy letter shapes for reading that also direct the way in which handwriting is best formed.
