<h4>About the design</h4>
<p>The Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family 'Muli', a typeface that has already proven popular with children and teachers.</p>
<p>The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, and extra features have been introduced with Topmarks to help children forming their own handwriting, for example, the extension of the ends of strokes to encourage a connection between the printed word and handwriting.</p></div>
