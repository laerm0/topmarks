<h4>About the design</h4>
<p>The Topmarks Fonts provide clear and easy letter shapes for reading that also direct children to ways in which handwriting is best formed. Topmarks fonts are based on the free software font family 'Muli', a typeface that has already proven popular with children and teachers. </p>
<p>The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, with the Topmarks design introducing features that are similar to popular precursive handwriting styles taught in schools.</p>
<p>Alternative letter forms will be available for characters such as k, f, 1, 4 and 9, as it is recognised that letter form styles can vary across early years education.</p>
