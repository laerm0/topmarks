<h4>About the design</h4>
<p>The Topmarks Fonts provide clear and easy letter shapes for reading that also direct children to ways in which handwriting is best formed.</p>
<p>The fonts are based on the free software font family 'Muli', a typeface that has already proven popular with children and teachers.</p>
<p>The forms of Muli are straightforward and easy to read, with the Topmarks design introducing features that are similar to popular precursive handwriting styles taught in schools.</p>

<p>It is intended that alternative letter formations will be available in some instances such as k, f, 1, 4 and 9, in the design as it is recognised that letter formation styles vary in early years educational establishments.</p>
